# SeekingShelter.Show-for-Women
Shelter &amp; Services for women who are victims of abuse

This project has been inspired by this github repo, https://github.com/codebridge-za/seeking-shelter

I am creating it using Vuetify and Google Maps...

This project has been developed using...

1. BANano - A B4x to Javascript transpiler.
